The code in this directory is related to variables and functions that prepare the arduino for a new experiment.

These functions include:

- Recieving experiment variables such as num_trials and num_stimuli
- Recieving experiment schedule so that the arduino knows what valves to actuate for a given trial
- Recieving valve actuation durations so that the arduino knows how long to leave a valve open to get a desired amount of stimulant
