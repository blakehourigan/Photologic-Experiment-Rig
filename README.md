# Upgraded-Experiment-Rig
All CAD files, code, circuity, and documentation for the new Samuelsen lab experiment rig. 

This distribution package includes files relevant to building the lick detector, described in 



For more detailed instructions on how to construct the detector, refer to the appendix of the above publication.

Basic instructions:
1. Download and print STL files on 3d printer. 
2. Machine out rig faceplates/door. 
3. Glue/screw together parts according to solidworks assembly file. 
4. Secure optical fibers to lick spout faceplates. 
5. Recreate circuitry on breadboards or order PCB for circuitry to interface the motor, solenoids and opical emitter/detector with the Arduino boards. 
6. Download Arduino code and upload to two Arduino boards. Download Python code to control rig hardware.

For an overall look at the final product, refer to the images in the Example folder.
